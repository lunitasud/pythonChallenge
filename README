### Mach Eight Challenge twon numbers addition

To solve the challenge, three Python functions with different search algorithms have been developed:

the first option is the class search algorithm with two nested cycles. it goes through the array and a copy of the array comparing each elemente with each of the other elements in the list. This function is called "Compare" and its complexity is N^2.

the second option is with the function "twoCompare", which performs the comparison of each element of the array with itself but executing a search from the extremes to the center. this algorithm has a polynomial complexity.

the third option is with the function "searchAdd" this function sorts the list through the Merge-sort function, then searches from a binary search method and reduces the size of the list on each hit. this algorithm has a complexity of 
NLog(N)

For execute the project, discard the repository on a pc whith a last version of python installed, the version used for the project is Python 3.10.2. Next is required to edit the numbers.txt file, writing a list of integer numbers separated with ',' character and finalize whith a target integer number separated whith space character before the same. Finally we can execute the controller.py file whith the command: /controller.py on the terminal window, and located in the folder of the project route.

The result of excution show in screen three lists whith the validation of the three algoritms developed for the challenge.

Thanks for read! ;)
